This is {bbw}\u0026rsquo;s third CRAN release since its maiden acceptance to CRAN almost 7 years ago (17 January 2018). Key updates include the streamlining of the resampling algorithm and the addition of the option to perform bootstrap resampling in parallel for a faster and more efficient process. The package is now also able to perform stratified bootstrap resampling out-of-the-box compared to previous version where users had to write additional code to setup stratification. Finally, the package now includes a convenience function for performing weighted post-stratification estimation. Before, users had to create additional script to perform this analysis.\nTo give you an idea of the new features, we compare the original bootBW() function to the new/alternative boot_bw() set of functions. We use the datasets for a rapid assessment method (RAM) survey on mother and child health and nutrition in three regions of Somalia included in the {bbw} package for this demonstration.\nThe indicatorsHH dataset is a survey dataset collected from a RAM survey in Bakool, Bay, and Middle Shabelle regions of Somalia. The villageData contains the list of villages/clusters that were sampled in the survey that collected the indicatorsHH dataset.\nOriginal bootstrapping workflow Bootstrap resampling with bootBW() The bootBW() function is the original bootstrap resampling function of the package. It can be used as follows:\nboot_df \u0026lt;- bootBW( x = indicatorsHH, w = villageData, statistic = bootClassic, params = c(\u0026quot;anc1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;anc2\u0026quot;) ) This call to bootBW() takes in the survey dataset indicatorsHH as its first argument (x). This dataset is expected to have a variable labelled as psu which identifies the primary sampling unit from which data was collected during the survey and then additional variables for the indicators to be estimated. The second argument (w) is for the dataset of the list of primary sampling units that were sampled in the survey to collect the survey data specified in x. This dataset, which in this case is villageData, should have at least a variable labelled psu which identified the primary sampling unit that matches the same variable in the survey dataset and a variable labelled pop for the population size of the primary sampling unit. The statistic argument specified the type of statistic to apply to the bootstrap replicates. There are two of these functions available from the {bbw} package - bootClassic() and the bootPROBIT(). For this example, the bootClassic() function is used to get the mean value of the bootstrap replicates. This is generally useful for binomial type of indicators and for continuous variables of which to get the mean of. The params argument takes in values of the indicator names in x to be estimated. In this example, two indicator names for antenatal care are specified. Finally, the argument for replicates specify the number of replicate bootstraps to be performed. The default of 400 replicates is used here. This results in the following (showing first 10 rows):\nhead(boot_df, 10) #\u0026gt; anc1 anc2 #\u0026gt; 1 0.1864175 0.01874714 #\u0026gt; 2 0.2290978 0.02035985 #\u0026gt; 3 0.2343529 0.02641509 #\u0026gt; 4 0.2548555 0.03084955 #\u0026gt; 5 0.2698864 0.02662863 #\u0026gt; 6 0.2151356 0.01819052 #\u0026gt; 7 0.1937834 0.02677702 #\u0026gt; 8 0.2148349 0.01678766 #\u0026gt; 9 0.2593480 0.02891566 #\u0026gt; 10 0.2151414 0.01922153 The result is a data.frame() of bootstrap replicates with number of rows equal to the number or replicates and number of columns equal to the number of params specified. Hence, boot_df has 400 rows and 2 columns.\nBootstrap estimation Using boot_df containing bootstrap replicates of the indicators anc1 and anc2, estimating each indicator with a 95% confidence interval using the percentile bootstrap method. This can be simply done using the quantile() function from the stats package as follows:\nest_df \u0026lt;- lapply( X = boot_df, FUN = quantile, probs = c(0.5, 0.025, 0.975) ) |\u0026gt; do.call(rbind, args = _) The quantile() function is used to get the 50th percentile (for the estimate) and the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap replicates to get the lower confidence limit and the upper confidence limits (respectively) of the indicator estimate. This gives the following results:\nest_df #\u0026gt; 50% 2.5% 97.5% #\u0026gt; anc1 0.2316597 0.17709920 0.28849265 #\u0026gt; anc2 0.0218962 0.01347537 0.03484835 Stratified bootstrap resampling Note that the indicatorsHH dataset has geographical stratification. Specifically, the survey from which this data was collected was designed to be representative of three regions in Somalia with the regions identified through the region variable in indicatorsHH. Because of this the more appropriate bootstrap resampling approach would be to resample within each region. To do this using the original bootBW() function would require restructuring the survey dataset by region and then passing the region-stratified datasets individually to the bootBW() function. This may look something like this:\n## Split indicators by region ---- indicators_by_region \u0026lt;- split(indicatorsHH, f = indicatorsHH$region) ## Split psus by region ---- psus_by_region \u0026lt;- split(villageData, f = villageData$region) ## Bootstrap boot_df \u0026lt;- Map( f = bootBW, x = indicators_by_region, w = psus_by_region, statistic = rep(list(get(\u0026quot;bootClassic\u0026quot;)), length(indicators_by_region)), params = rep(list(c(\u0026quot;anc1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;anc2\u0026quot;)), length(indicators_by_region)) ) The bootBW() function only accepts single data.frame inputs for x and w arguments. Hence, to resample data from within region, the datasets will have to be split into separate data.frame inputs per region and then bootBW() applied to each separately. In the example above, this is done by concatenating each of the inputs to bootBW() into a list and then using the Map() function is sent to bootBW() sequentially. This produces a list of the data.frame bootstrap resample for each region (shown below):\nclass(boot_df) #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026quot;list\u0026quot; head(boot_df$Bay, 10) #\u0026gt; anc1 anc2 #\u0026gt; 1 0.4043419 0.013568521 #\u0026gt; 2 0.3907104 0.020491803 #\u0026gt; 3 0.3224044 0.023224044 #\u0026gt; 4 0.2645862 0.016282225 #\u0026gt; 5 0.2708618 0.008207934 #\u0026gt; 6 0.3297151 0.024423338 #\u0026gt; 7 0.3627717 0.004076087 #\u0026gt; 8 0.3662551 0.016460905 #\u0026gt; 9 0.3410641 0.016371078 #\u0026gt; 10 0.2277628 0.014824798 head(boot_df$Bakool, 10) #\u0026gt; anc1 anc2 #\u0026gt; 1 0.2916667 0.17415730 #\u0026gt; 2 0.2928177 0.09497207 #\u0026gt; 3 0.3260274 0.14804469 #\u0026gt; 4 0.2747253 0.11864407 #\u0026gt; 5 0.2900552 0.11797753 #\u0026gt; 6 0.1823204 0.05849582 #\u0026gt; 7 0.4065934 0.16343490 #\u0026gt; 8 0.2727273 0.11731844 #\u0026gt; 9 0.2821918 0.06944444 #\u0026gt; 10 0.2939560 0.09749304 head(boot_df$`Middle Shabelle`, 10) #\u0026gt; anc1 anc2 #\u0026gt; 1 0.1723447 0.011055276 #\u0026gt; 2 0.2550607 0.018367347 #\u0026gt; 3 0.1330724 0.010816126 #\u0026gt; 4 0.2830189 0.024551464 #\u0026gt; 5 0.1921569 0.014792899 #\u0026gt; 6 0.2217782 0.010989011 #\u0026gt; 7 0.2117647 0.007881773 #\u0026gt; 8 0.2165156 0.019172553 #\u0026gt; 9 0.2195122 0.015625000 #\u0026gt; 10 0.2274549 0.015075377 To estimate the per region results from this bootstrap resampling, the following can be implemented:\nest_df \u0026lt;- lapply( X = boot_df, FUN = function(x) lapply( x, FUN = quantile, probs = c(0.5, 0.025, 0.975) ) |\u0026gt; do.call(rbind, args = _) ) est_df \u0026lt;- data.frame( region = names(est_df), indicators = lapply(est_df, FUN = row.names) |\u0026gt; unlist(), do.call(rbind, args = est_df) ) row.names(est_df) \u0026lt;- NULL which results in the following output:\nest_df #\u0026gt; region indicators X50.

However, as shown above, this flexibility requires a lot more extra coding from the user to get from resampling to indicator estimates.\nStarting from v0.3.0, an alternative set of functions is available to perform blocked weighted bootstrap resampling that facilitates all the steps from resampling to estimation. Below is an example of how to use this alternative set of functions for the same tasks shown above.\nThis set of functions attempts to make the blocked weighted bootstrap algorithm more efficient through vectorisation and use of parallelisation techniques. The function syntax has been kept consistent with bootBW() for ease of transition.\nBootstrap resampling with boot_bw() The boot_bw() function is the alternative bootstrap resampling function of the package. It can be used as follows:\nboot_df \u0026lt;- boot_bw( x = indicatorsHH, w = villageData, statistic = bootClassic, params = c(\u0026quot;anc1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;anc2\u0026quot;) ) This call to boot_bw() takes in the survey dataset indicatorsHH as its first argument (x). This dataset is expected to have a variable labelled as psu which identifies the primary sampling unit from which data was collected during the survey and then additional variables for the indicators to be estimated. The second argument (w) is for the dataset of the list of primary sampling units that were sampled in the survey to collect the survey data specified in x. This dataset, which in this case is villageData, should have at least a variable labelled psu which identified the primary sampling unit that matches the same variable in the survey dataset and a variable labelled pop for the population size of the primary sampling unit. The statistic argument specified the type of statistic to apply to the bootstrap replicates. There are two of these functions available from the {bbw} package - bootClassic() and the bootPROBIT(). For this example, the bootClassic() function is used to get the mean value of the bootstrap replicates. This is generally useful for binomial type of indicators and for continuous variables of which to get the mean of. The params argument takes in values of the indicator names in x to be estimated. In this example, two indicator names for antenatal care are specified. Finally, the argument for replicates specify the number of replicate bootstraps to be performed. The default of 400 replicates is used here. As can be noted, the boot_bw() takes on the same type of arguments as bootBW() and the syntax is exactly the same. Hence, using this alternative function will be familiar to those who have had experience using the original function.\nHowever, the output of the boot_bw() function is structured differently from the bootBW() function. The boot_bw() function produces and object of class boot_bw.\nclass(boot_df) #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026quot;boot_bw\u0026quot; The object boot_bw is a list with 4 named components: params for the values specified for the params argument, replicates for the number of bootstrap replicates performed, strata for the values specified for stratification, and boot_data which is the bootstrap results.\nnames(boot_df) #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026quot;params\u0026quot; \u0026quot;replicates\u0026quot; \u0026quot;strata\u0026quot; \u0026quot;boot_data\u0026quot; The boot_data component of the boot_bw object corresponds to the output of the bootBW() function.\nOther than the difference in the structure of the output, this alternative function also has three additional arguments for the new features it provides.\nstrata - the variable name in x that provides information on the stratification in the survey data. This is by default set to NULL signifying no stratification. This argument allows the user to perform stratified bootstrap resampling conveniently through the boot_bw() function.\nparallel - whether or not to use parallel computation for the bootstrap resampling. This is by default set to FALSE in which case bootstrap resampling is done sequentially as is with the bootBW() function. If set to TRUE, the function sets up parallel computing and utilises the machines available cores (see cores argument below).\ncores - the number of cores to use for parallel computation. This is only evaluated if parallel = TRUE. By default, this is set to 1 less the total available number of cores of the current machine.\nTo use these new features and functionality, the call to boot_bw() would look something like this:\nboot_df \u0026lt;- boot_bw( x = indicatorsHH, w = villageData, statistic = bootClassic, params = c(\u0026quot;anc1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;anc2\u0026quot;), strata = \u0026quot;region\u0026quot;, parallel = TRUE ) This produces a boot_bw class list object with the same components as above. The only different is that the boot_data component is a list (instead of a data.frame) with each component being the data.frame bootstrap resampling output for each of the strata in the dataset.\nclass(boot_df) #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026quot;boot_bw\u0026quot; class(boot_df$boot_data) #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026quot;list\u0026quot; names(boot_df$boot_data) #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026quot;Bakool\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Bay\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Middle Shabelle\u0026quot; Bootstrap estimation The boot_bw_estimate() function can then be applied to the output of the boot_bw() function to get the indicator estimates with 95% confidence interval.\nboot_bw_estimate(boot_df) #\u0026gt; region indicator est lcl ucl #\u0026gt; 1 Bakool anc1 0.43888889 0.38881944 0.48888889 #\u0026gt; 2 Bakool anc2 0.38055556 0.32497749 0.43062500 #\u0026gt; 3 Bay anc1 0.71619066 0.63887512 0.77849135 #\u0026gt; 4 Bay anc2 0.00254615 0.00000000 0.01294677 #\u0026gt; 5 Middle Shabelle anc1 0.20757542 0.14514451 0.28293531 #\u0026gt; 6 Middle Shabelle anc2 0.05065259 0.03133757 0.07453108 #\u0026gt; se #\u0026gt; 1 0.027718319 #\u0026gt; 2 0.027983726 #\u0026gt; 3 0.036466569 #\u0026gt; 4 0.003743969 #\u0026gt; 5 0.036375151 #\u0026gt; 6 0.011463590 These two functions can be piped to each other for a single workflow from bootstrap resampling to estimation.\nboot_bw( x = indicatorsHH, w = villageData, statistic = bootClassic, params = c(\u0026quot;anc1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;anc2\u0026quot;), strata = \u0026quot;region\u0026quot;, parallel = TRUE ) |\u0026gt; boot_bw_estimate() #\u0026gt; region indicator est lcl ucl #\u0026gt; 1 Bakool anc1 0.438888889 0.3805556 0.49444444 #\u0026gt; 2 Bakool anc2 0.376731302 0.3138889 0.43888889 #\u0026gt; 3 Bay anc1 0.719130072 0.6487833 0.78255787 #\u0026gt; 4 Bay anc2 0.002534854 0.0000000 0.01262706 #\u0026gt; 5 Middle Shabelle anc1 0.203423968 0.1428536 0.27819673 #\u0026gt; 6 Middle Shabelle anc2 0.051256281 0.0339071 0.07622767 #\u0026gt; se #\u0026gt; 1 0.030425611 #\u0026gt; 2 0.030033802 #\u0026gt; 3 0.034273078 #\u0026gt; 4 0.003372086 #\u0026gt; 5 0.033966913 #\u0026gt; 6 0.010573679 More efficient bootstrap resampling A key feature of the most recent {bbw} update is its new function set that uses parallelisation for bootstrap resampling.

The ennet package has two key sets of functions:\nThe first set of functions facilitates the extraction of text data from the en-net online forum.\nThe second set of functions supports the analysis of the extracted datasets to produce summary measures and statistics of the en-net online forum.\nUsage The ennet data extraction workflow ennet package provides a set of functions that extracts information from the en-net online forum. This set of functions was built on top of the rvest package which provides robust and performant web scraping functions and the dplyr package which provides a full suite of data manipulation functions. The ennet package was designed to be able to interact with how the en-net online forum has been structured.\nen-net website structure The en-net online forum website has a very clear and clean structure. The opening page is a list of thematic areas which are linked to each of their respective webpages. In each of these thematic area webpages is another list, this time a list of topics raised within the thematic area. These topics are the text that an online user provides as the title for the question she/he is going to ask. Each of the topics are then again linked to their respective webpages that show the actual full question raised and the ensuing responses and discussion stemming from that question.\nBased on this structure, the following functions are available from the ennet package for extracting text data:\nget_themes - function to get a list of thematic areas in the forum;\nget_theme_topics and get_themes_topics - functions to get list of topics for a specific thematic area or thematic areas; and,\nget_topic_discussions and get_topics_discussions - functions to get list of discussions for a specific topic or topics,\nFor a more detailed discussion of the data extraction workflow via the ennet package, read Utilities to Extract Text Data from en-net.\nThe ennet analytics functions The ennet package also includes analytic functions that summarises the text data available from the en-net online forum. Currently, there are four analytic functions available from ennet:\ncount_topics - function to count the number of topics or questions by theme and date;\ncount_authors - function to count the number of topics attributed to a specific author;\narrange_views - function to arrange topics by number of views; and,\narrange_replies - function to arrange topics by number of replies.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the analytics functions available from the ennet package, read Summarising en-net online forum statistics.\nUtilities and datasets In addition to these two sets of key functions, ennet package also includes a function - update_topics - that extracts the en-net online forum dataset and updates it at a given time interval. This is a convenience wrapper function to get_themes_topics that is potentially useful for those who wants to build dashboards or applications that uses data from the en-net online forum.\nTwo datasets are also included in the en-net package. The first dataset is a data.frame of en-net online forum themes and the second dataset is a data.frame of en-net online forum topics.\nPractical applications The en-net online forum is a rich resource for understanding the community of users that participate in it. And given how an online forum is designed, that resource can be tapped relatively easily given that the documentation of the interaction and discussion between its users happens in real-time. The ennet package facilitates the access to that information through the statistical analysis tool R with which further levels of analysis can be applied to generate meaningful and valuable understanding of this specific community and to some extent the greater nutrition sector at large.\nFollowing are a few practical and meaningful applications of the information generated by the en-net online forum.\nAssess effectiveness of the en-net online forum The data from the en-net online forum can be used to assess effectiveness of the forum. Effectiveness can be defined as whether the forum has been able to achieve its stated aims/objectives when it was started. Effectiveness can also be expressed in terms of indicators or metrics that reflect overarching principles, ideals or values that those who started the forum adhere to or that the community of users and the wider sector or society believe in. These may include values of inclusion, participation, scientific rigour among others. Given that the forum has been in existence for many years now, information is available over the same period allowing for assessing temporal variation in effectiveness (as defined). This application is a more normative approach and will involve creating or developing metrics or taking relevant metrics from other sectors and applying those to this case.\nIdentify gaps in information, knowledge and/or skills Given the nature of the en-net online forum as a quick point of recourse for field practitioners to seek answers to practical questions and challenges faced, it can be expected that the data from the forum contains information on what these topics are. These information can then be used to identify most common or most important information, knowledge and skills that have been asked about. By identifying these gaps in information, knowledge and/or skills and by understanding the evolution of these needs over time, we can potentially predict training needs in the near term and over time. This application is a more formative approach in that we let the data tell us what information it holds.\nSummary The ennet package provides R users access to text data from the en-net online forum which can be used for various purposes. In the coming weeks, we\u0026rsquo;ll be using the ennet package to draw data from the en-net online forum to analyse the topics and discussions in the forum and answer questions that may offer a deeper insight into the community that the online forum fosters.\nIf you have ideas of questions to explore through the ennet package, let us know here.\n","date":1606177800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606260600,"objectID":"4c2ed53235fc0ceb13d81540081f2b53","permalink":"https://katilingban.io/post/extract-analyse-ennet-forum/","publishdate":"2020-11-24T00:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/extract-analyse-ennet-forum/","section":"post","summary":"R package that provides utility functions for the extraction, processing and analysis of text data from the en-net online forum","tags":["enn","text","nlp","nutrition"],"title":"ennet: Utilities to Extract and Analyse Text Data from the Emergency Nutrition Network (en-net) Forum","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ernest Guevarra"],"categories":["Software","R"],"content":"We just launched the eighth release (version 0.5.3) of ppitables, our R package containing Poverty Probability Index (PPI®) lookup tables for the 61 countries where PPI® can be calculated. The PPI® is a poverty measurement tool for organisations and businesses with a mission to serve the poor created by Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA).\nInitially released in March of 2018, ppitables has now been downloaded by more than 12,000 R users averaging more than 500 downloads per month.\nWe developed ppitables to support our use of the PPI® for surveys and assessments we have conducted. Our main use case for PPI® is as an alternative means to classify wealth in our survey sample as opposed to the more widely used and traditional household asset listing and application of principal components analysis (PCA) for household wealth ranking used by the World Bank and by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Using the answers to just 10 questions about a household\u0026rsquo;s characteristics and asset ownership, a score is calculated and the likelihood of a household living below poverty line is computed. To learn more about the PPI®, its history and development, go here. To read more about how to use PPI®, click here.\nThe ppitables package is aimed at R users whose work and/or research includes the use of the PPI®. The package facilitates the conversion of country-specific household PPI® score into a poverty likelihood value for a household. Users can immediately write appropriate scripts to convert data they may have of a sample of households in a particular country into the respective poverty probabilities using the country-specific lookup tables.\nIn this eighth iteration of the package, we have added the most recently released lookup tables for Malawi that uses IPA\u0026rsquo;s current approach to calculating poverty probabilities. For more information about ppitables and how to use it, visit the package website. To view the package source code, see the package\u0026rsquo;s GitHub repository.\nIf you have used ppitables before or have used it recently, we\u0026rsquo;d love to hear from you for feedback and comments.

A Cebuano word meaning 1) a group or a community of people; 2) society, organisation or club.\nIt is at times of extreme social struggle and difficulty that we are reminded of the primacy of the collective and the value of working towards the common good. The current global health crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic along with the social upheaval caused by the continuing and persistent racial injustice in the United States recently sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer and which has grown into a worldwide Black Lives Matter movement are the signs of the times. And these are the times when the power of collective action towards the common good is even more crucial.\nIt is against this backdrop that I, together with three other colleagues, have founded Katilingban, a collective of multi-disciplinary experts and practitioners in public health and nutrition. Though coming from different nationalities and diverse backgrounds and experiences, one of our main commonalities is our community-based orientation - from a doctor who ran a community-based mental health programme for civil war-affected children and youth in the Philippines, to a public health practitioner who studies and works with communities to understand their context to inform health and nutrition programming, to a community health and nutrition expert who has performed multiple coverage assessments and evaluations of community-based nutrition programmes in the past decade illustrating how the community aspect of these programmes has mostly been poorly done, and to a nutrition data expert who has implemented numerous nutrition surveys to aid in the design and planning of nutrition programmes advocating for more community participation in programme design and planning. And it is this community-based orientation that inspired us to form our own collective, to form Katilingban.\nFor the remainder of 2020, we would like to once again emphasise the importance of coverage of health and nutrition programming more so in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has disrupted health and nutrition in more ways than just the infection itself. The global focus on COVID-19 has potentially further widened disparities in other health and nutrition outcomes particularly in low and middle income countries through a variety of mechanisms. We would like to collaborate with other organisations and researchers who are keen on assessing the impact of the pandemic on various aspects of health and nutrition in low and middle income countries. And given the limitations posed by the pandemic, we would like to explore the use of relatively new or less utilised modalities of primary data collection and to test and utilise other analytical techniques on already existing secondary data and routine programme data taht would allow us to still examine and understand the on-going health and nutrition situation other than COVID-19.\nInterested in collaborating?
